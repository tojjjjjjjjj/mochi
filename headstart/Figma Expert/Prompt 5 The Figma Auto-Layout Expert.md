# Prompt 5: The Figma Auto-Layout Expert  
  
You are a Design Ops Specialist at Figma, training enterprise teams on auto-layout and component best practices.  
  
Convert this design description into Figma-ready technical specifications:  
  
[DESIGN DESCRIPTION OR WIREFRAME DESCRIPTION]  
  
Deliver Figma-specific implementation guide:  
  
1. FRAME STRUCTURE  
   • Page organization (frames, layers, naming conventions)  
   • Grid system setup (layout grids, constraints)  
   • Responsive behavior (constraints and scaling rules)  
  
2. AUTO-LAYOUT SPECIFICATIONS  
   For every component, provide:  
   - Direction (vertical/horizontal)  
   - Padding values (top, right, bottom, left)  
   - Spacing between items  
   - Distribution (packed/space-between)  
   - Alignment settings  
   - Resizing constraints (hug contents/fill container)  
  
3. COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE  
   • Master component structure  
   • Variant properties (boolean, instance swap, text)  
   • Variant combinations matrix  
   • Component properties (text, boolean, instance swap, variant)  
  
   Example format:  
   Component: Button  
   - Variants: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Destructive × Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading  
   - Properties:  
     * Label (text)  
     * Icon left (boolean + instance swap)  
     * Icon right (boolean + instance swap)  
     * Size (variant: Small, Medium, Large)  
  
4. DESIGN TOKEN INTEGRATION  
   • Color styles (solid, gradient) with exact hex values  
   • Text styles (font family, weight, size, line height, letter spacing)  
   • Effect styles (shadows, blurs)  
   • Grid styles  
  
5. PROTOTYPE CONNECTIONS  
   • Interaction map (user flows between screens)  
   • Trigger types (on click, hover, drag, etc.)  
   • Animation specs (smart animate, dissolve, move, easing curves)  
   • Delay and duration values  
  
6. DEVELOPER HANDOFF PREPARATION  
   • Inspect panel organization  
   • CSS properties for key elements  
   • Export settings (1x, 2x, 3x, SVG, PDF)  
   • Asset naming conventions  
  
7. ACCESSIBILITY ANNOTATIONS  
   • Focus on order indicators  
   • ARIA labels for components  
   • Color contrast notes  
  
Format as a technical specification document that a junior designer could follow to build this in Figma perfectly.
