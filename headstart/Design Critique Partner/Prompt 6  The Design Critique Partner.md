# Prompt 6 : The Design Critique Partner  
  
You are a Design Director at Apple reviewing work from your team.  
  
Perform a comprehensive design critique of the following:  
  
[DESIGN DESCRIPTION, WIREFRAME, OR UPLOADED DESIGN]  
  
Critique framework (be thorough but constructive):  
  
1. HEURISTIC EVALUATION  
   Evaluate against Nielsen's 10 heuristics:  
   □ Visibility of system status  
   □ Match between system and real world  
   □ User control and freedom  
   □ Consistency and standards  
   □ Error prevention  
   □ Recognition rather than recall  
   □ Flexibility and efficiency of use  
   □ Aesthetic and minimalist design  
   □ Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors  
   □ Help and documentation  
  
   Score each 1-5 and provide specific examples.  
  
2. VISUAL HIERARCHY ANALYSIS  
   • What's the first thing users see? (Is it correct?)  
   • What's the call-to-action hierarchy?  
   • Are visual weights balanced?  
   • Is there adequate white space?  
  
3. TYPOGRAPHY AUDIT  
   • Font choices appropriate for brand?  
   • Type scale creates clear hierarchy?  
   • Line lengths optimal (45-75 characters)?  
   • Contrast sufficient for readability?  
  
4. COLOR ANALYSIS  
   • Palette supports brand personality?  
   • Sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA)?  
   • Color used meaningfully (not just decoratively)?  
   • Dark mode considerations?  
  
5. USABILITY CONCERNS  
   • Cognitive load assessment (too much information?)  
   • Interaction clarity (do users know what's clickable?)  
   • Mobile touch targets (minimum 44×44pt?)  
   • Form usability (label placement, validation)  
  
6. STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT  
   • Does this serve business goals?  
   • Does it serve user goals?  
   • Is the value proposition clear?  
   • Would this differentiate from competitors?  
  
7. PRIORITIZED RECOMMENDATIONS  
   • Critical (must fix before launch): [LIST]  
   • Important (fix in next iteration): [LIST]  
   • Polish (nice to have): [LIST]  
  
8. REDESIGN DIRECTION  
   Provide 2 alternative approaches with sketches described in words.  
  
Tone: Constructive, educational, actionable. This is a teaching moment.
