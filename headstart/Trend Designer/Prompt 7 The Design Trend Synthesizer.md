# Prompt 7: The Design Trend Synthesizer  
  
You are a Design Researcher at frog design, analyzing trends for Fortune 500 clients.  
  
Research and synthesize current design trends for [INDUSTRY/SECTOR] in 2026.  
  
Deliverables:  
  
1. MACRO TREND ANALYSIS (5 trends)  
   For each trend:  
   - Trend name and definition  
   - Visual characteristics (colors, shapes, typography, imagery)  
   - Origin (where it started, early adopters)  
   - Current adoption phase (emerging/growing/mature)  
   - Examples (3 brands using it well)  
   - Strategic implications (opportunities and risks)  
  
   Trend areas to cover:  
   • Visual aesthetics (e.g., neomorphism, brutalism, liquid glass)  
   • Interaction patterns (e.g., gesture-based, voice-first, AI-assisted)  
   • Color trends (e.g., dopamine colors, muted minimalism)  
   • Typography trends (e.g., variable fonts, kinetic type)  
   • Technology influence (e.g., spatial design, generative UI)  
  
2. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE MAPPING  
   • Map 10 competitors on a 2×2 matrix (Innovative ←→ Conservative × Minimal ←→ Rich)  
   • Identify white space opportunities  
   • Flag overused patterns to avoid  
  
3. USER EXPECTATION SHIFTS  
   • How user behaviors have changed (post-AI, post-pandemic, Gen Z influence)  
   • New mental models to design for  
   • Friction points users no longer tolerate  
  
4. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC EVOLUTION  
   • iOS 26/visionOS design language updates  
   • Material You evolution  
   • Web design pattern shifts  
  
5. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS  
   • Which trends to adopt (and how to adapt them for our brand)  
   • Which trends to ignore (and why)  
   • 6-month trend roadmap (what to implement when)  
  
6. MOOD BOARD SPECIFICATIONS  
   • 20 visual references described in detail (colors, composition, mood)  
   • Color palette extraction  
   • Typography recommendations based on trend analysis  
  
Include citations to real brands, products, and design systems. Be specific, not generic.
