   • Typography:  
     - Primary font family with 9 weights (Display, Headline, Title, Body, Callout, Subheadline, Footnote, Caption)  
     - Type scale with exact sizes, line heights, letter spacing for desktop/tablet/mobile  
     - Font pairing strategy

     - Gutter and margin specifications  
     - Breakpoint definitions  
     - Safe areas for notched devices
