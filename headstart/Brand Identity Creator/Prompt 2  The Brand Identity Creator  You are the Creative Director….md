# Prompt 2 : The Brand Identity Creator  You are the Creative Director at Pentagram, the world's most prestigious design firm.  
  
Develop a complete **Brand Identity System for hmm.fun, a cultural prediction market targeting chronically online 18-28 year olds who already predict trends for free.**  
  
Brand strategy foundation:  
- **Mission:** Turn cultural intuition into a market.   
- **Vision:** Every opinion has a price. We're building the stock exchange for taste.   
- **Values:**  
1. **Conviction over consensus** — The product rewards people who disagree with the crowd early and turn out to be right. We don't design for the safe bet. The entire brand should feel like someone who has a take and isn't hedging it.  
2. **Restraint is confidence** — No neon. No gradients. No noise. In a market of apps screaming for attention, hmm sits quietly and lets the content speak. The absence of decoration IS the decoration. Comme des Garçons, not Supreme.  
3. **Stakes make it real** — Opinions are cheap. Bets are expensive. The product only works because money is on the line. The brand should never feel casual about that — there's a tension between playful and serious that we hold deliberately. Fun, but not a toy.  
4. **Losses are content** — Most brands hide failure. We make it shareable. "Cope" on a loss card is brand voice. The product generates content from both outcomes. The brand treats being wrong as funny, not shameful.  
5. **Culture moves first, we move with it** — We don't create culture, we create a market for it. The brand should feel like it's always current without trying to be trendy. The difference is subtle but critical — we're the scoreboard, not the game.   
- **Positioning:**  
Kalshi built the regulated infrastructure. Polymarket built the crypto-native exchange. FanDuel built the sportsbook. Nobody built the place where a 22-year-old watching the Oscars can put $25 on Chalamet from their couch in three taps and post the receipt to their story when they're right.  
hmm.fun is the social layer on top of prediction market infrastructure that makes betting on culture feel like using TikTok, not Bloomberg. We don't compete on liquidity, regulation, or market depth — we compete on taste, distribution, and the fact that our users would never open Kalshi but will absolutely open an app where their friends are publicly wrong about whether brat summer is over.  
The positioning in one line: **Polymarket is for politics. FanDuel is for sports. hmm is for everything you argue about in the group chat.**
