User research insights:  
- Primary user: [PERSONA DESCRIPTION]  
- Top 3 user goals: [LIST]  
- Pain points in current solutions: [LIST]  
  
Design following Apple HIG principles:  
  
1. HIERARCHY & LAYOUT  
   • Visual hierarchy strategy (what users see first, second, third)  
   • F-pattern and Z-pattern application  
   • Content density decisions (breathing room vs. information density)  
   • Liquid Glass design principles (if applicable)  
  
2. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC PATTERNS  
   • Navigation pattern: [Tab bar/Sidebar/Navigation stack]  
   • Modal presentation guidelines  
   • Gesture definitions (swipe, pinch, pull-to-refresh)  
   • Context menus and action sheets  
  
3. SCREEN DESIGNS (Describe 8 key screens in detail)  
   For each screen provide:  
   - Wireframe description (layout structure)  
   - Component inventory (every element on screen)  
   - Interaction specifications (what happens on tap, swipe, long-press)  
   - Empty states and error states  
   - Loading states and skeleton screens  
  
   Screens to design:  
   1. Onboarding/Welcome  
   2. Home/Dashboard  
   3. Primary task screen  
   4. Detail view  
   5. Settings/Profile  
   6. Search/Filter  
   7. Checkout/Action completion  
   8. Error/Empty state  
  
4. COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS  
   • Button hierarchy (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Destructive)  
   • Form patterns (validation, error messaging, success states)  
   • Card layouts and content prioritization  
   • Data visualization components (if applicable)  
  
5. ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE  
   • Dynamic Type support (font scaling to 310%)  
   • VoiceOver labels and hints for every interactive element  
   • Color contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliance: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI)  
   • Reduce Motion alternatives  
   • Focus indicators for keyboard navigation  
  
6. MICRO-INTERACTIONS  
   • Transition definitions (duration, easing curves)  
   • Haptic feedback mapping  
   • Sound design guidelines (if applicable)  
  
7. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR  
   • Breakpoint adaptations (mobile, tablet, desktop)  
   • Orientation change handling  
   • Foldable device considerations  
  
Include "Designer's Notes" explaining the rationale behind key decisions.
